BUGS
- sometimes characters are generated on walls smh
- what happens in multiple simultaneous npc interaction

IMPROVEMENTS
- put the selectable options 1 - 2 - 3 in different color
- add a full example of a few interactions
- add a random vibe in the beginning

FEATS
- fog of war
- make the characters disappear after they are done
- can we do speaker using whispers?

- how can I split the story making in multiple parts, that are independent from one another
	- instead of bringing all the history with me all the time, I can just bring the overall story
	- and a recap of what happened
